# Malaria Cell Images Classification
This repository contains the notebooks used on the experiment of training
three convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers for the
[Malaria Cell Images Dataset][kaggle-dataset] on Kaggle.

The experiment were executed on google colab, with the models implemented
using pytorch and the training procedure implemented with the
[ignite library][ignite].
